DESCRIPTION
       GoAhead is popular, simple embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast,
       small-footprint, single-threaded, standards-based, portable server
       developed for use by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as
       a stand-alone web server or the GoAhead library can be embedded in
       applications.

       GoAhead supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest, basic and web-form
       authentication, chunked transfers, file upload and sandbox security
       limits.

       When goahead is built, it is configured to open a port for HTTP
       requests and optionally one for SSL. However, if goahead is invoked
       with an IP address or port number on the command line, GoAhead will
       listen on these ports instead.  If the PORT component is omitted,
       GoAhead will listen on port 80. If the IP address is omitted and a port
       is supplied, GoAhead will listen on all network interfaces.

OPTIONS
       --auth filename
              Define the name of the authentication configuration file. This
              is by default auth.txt.  If GoAhead is built with PAM support
              (Unix Pluggable Authentication Modules), then passwords will be
              authenticated from the system password database.

       --debugger
              Run GoAhead in debug mode and disable all timeouts. This
              disables request and session timeouts.  The -d option is an
              alias for --debugger.

       --log logSpec
              Name the GoAhead log file. This will override the ErrorLog
              directive in the configuration file.  When the maximum size is
              exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a new
              log file will be started. The -l option is an alias for --log.
              The syntax is:

              --log logName[:logLevel]

       --home directory
              Output the product version number.
